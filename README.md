## Functions Overview

### Learning Outcome: Functions

- **sum_of_squares(n: int)**: Calculates the sum of the squares of all integers from 1 to n.
- **evaluate_performance(grades: list, min_pass: int)**: Evaluates student performance based on grades and a minimum passing grade.
- **calculate_cumulative_performance(scores: dict)**: Computes the average score and identifies subjects with below-average scores.
- **analyze_improvement(scores: list)**: Analyzes the trend of improvement based on a list of scores.
- **rank_students(students: list[tuple[str, int]])**: Ranks students based on their scores.

### Learning Outcome: Basic Loops

- **even_numbers(n: int)**: Generates a list of even numbers from 1 to n.
- **odd_numbers(n: int)**: Generates a list of odd numbers from 1 to n.
- **sum_multiples_of_num(num: int, length: int)**: Calculates the sum of multiples of a given number up to a specified length.
- **skip_num(n: int, length: int)**: Generates a list of numbers from 1 to length, skipping a specific number.
- **break_test(n: int, length: int)**: Generates a list of numbers from 1 to length, stopping when a specific number is encountered.
- **sum_numbers_until_zero(nums: list)**: Sums numbers in a list until a zero is encountered.
- **count_positive_numbers(nums: list)**: Counts the number of positive integers in a list.
- **sum_dictionary_values(dictionary: dict)**: Sums all values in a dictionary.
- **sum_unique_elements(elements: list)**: Sums unique elements in a list.
- **skip_divisible_by_num(n: int, length: int)**: Generates a list of numbers from 1 to length, skipping those divisible by a specific number.

### Learning Outcome: Processing Data

- **square_numbers(nums: list)**: Calculates the square of each number in a list.
- **transform_string(input: str, transform: str)**: Transforms a string based on the specified transformation type (capitalize, upper, lower).
- **sum_and_average(nums: list[int])**: Calculates the sum and average of a list of numbers.
- **word_frequency_count(words: list[str])**: Counts the frequency of each word in a list.
- **filter_even_numbers(nums: list[int])**: Filters out even numbers from a list.
